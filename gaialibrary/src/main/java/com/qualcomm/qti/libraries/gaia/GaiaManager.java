/**
 * <p>This class manages the sending and receiving of packets using the GAIA protocol.</p>
 * <p>This protocol is used through two different transports:
 * {@link com.qualcomm.qti.libraries.gaia.GAIA.Transport#BLE BLE} and
 * {@link com.qualcomm.qti.libraries.gaia.GAIA.Transport#BR_EDR BR_EDR}. Depending on the transport the structure of a GAIA
 * packet is different, see {@link GaiaPacketBLE GaiaPacketBLE} and {@link GaiaPacketBREDR GaiaPacketBREDR} for more
 * information. The transport this manager uses can only be defined when creating this manager, through the class
 * constructor.</p>
 * <p>For any byte array known as a potential GAIA packet, it is passed to this manager using
 * {@link #onReceiveGAIAPacket(byte[]) onReceiveGAIAPacket}. This method will then analyze the array in order to
 * get a {@link GaiaPacket GaiaPacket}. Then depending on the content of this packet one of the following abstract
 * methods is called:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>If the packet is an acknowledgement packet:
 *     {@link #receiveSuccessfulAcknowledgement(GaiaPacket) receiveSuccessfulAcknowledgement} or
 *     {@link #receiveUnsuccessfulAcknowledgement(GaiaPacket) receiveUnsuccessfulAcknowledgement}.</li>
 *     <li>Otherwise: {@link #manageReceivedPacket(GaiaPacket) manageReceivedPacket}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * This way the application only has to provide the process which is implementation dependant through the
 * implementation of these abstract methods.</p>
 * <p>This manager provides a {@link #createRequest(GaiaPacket) createRequest} method in order to send a GAIA Packet
 * to the device and to inform the application if it has not received a corresponding acknowledgement packet, see
 * {@link #hasNotReceivedAcknowledgementPacket(GaiaPacket) hasNotReceivedAcknowledgementPacket}. To define the time
 * before declaring the request as timed out, use {@link #setRequestTimeOut(int) setRequestTimeOut}. The default time is
 * {@link #ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_RUNNABLE_DEFAULT_DELAY_MILLIS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_RUNNABLE_DEFAULT_DELAY_MILLIS}.</p>
 * <p>This manager should be reset when the device is disconnected.</p>
